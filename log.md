### Day 4: September 13, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts** Resumed doing Leetcode style problems. Started with some easy ones. Definitely feeling the rust in writing code in Java. However, the builtin data structures are coming back to me and I still have a feel for O-Notation.

### Day 5: September 14, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode/HackerRannk Problems

**Thoughts** Continued with some more LeetCode/HackerRank style problems. It's starting to come back and some the easy level problems are more manageable. Need to quicky ramp up the difficulty to grow faster.
